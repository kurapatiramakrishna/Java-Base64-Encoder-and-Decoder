# Java-Base64-Encoder-and-Decoder
 This repository contains Java code demonstrating how to perform Base64 encoding and decoding. It includes two classes, StringToBase64 and Base64ToString, which showcase the conversion of regular strings to Base64 encoding and the reverse process of decoding Base64 encoded strings back to their original forms.
